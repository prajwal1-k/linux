# Bash Prompt

> In the Bash shell, the prompt is what you see when the shell is ready to accept a command.
It's typically something like:
`username@hostname:~$`

> `[~]$` Here ~ = **Present working directory (pwd)** and the $ = **User prompt symbol**

```bash
prajwal@prajwal:~$ echo $PS1
[\W]$
```
- \W = Present working directory
- $ = prompt symbol

### Customize the Prompt

```bash
prajwal@prajwal:~$ PS1 = "ubuntu-server:"
```
```bash
prajwal@prajwal:~$ echo $PS1
ubuntu-server:
```
