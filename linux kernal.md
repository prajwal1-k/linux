# üêß Linux Kernel

The **Linux kernel** is the core part of the Linux operating system. It is a free, open-source, monolithic, Unix-like operating system kernel created by **Linus Torvalds** in 1991. It handles communication between hardware and software components, manages system resources, and enables multitasking and device control.

## üîç Overview

The Linux kernel forms the foundation of many operating systems including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Android, and countless others. It is:
- **Modular**: Uses loadable kernel modules (LKMs)
- **Portable**: Runs on a wide range of hardware platforms
- **Secure**: Implements permission systems, security modules, and namespaces
- **Scalable**: Powers everything from smartphones to supercomputers

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- Process Scheduling
- Virtual Memory Management
- Virtual File System (VFS)
- Device Drivers
- Networking (TCP/IP, IPv6, Netfilter)
- Security Modules (SELinux, AppArmor)
- Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

## üß© Kernel Components
**1. üß± Process Scheduler (Process Management)**

> Handles the **creation, scheduling, and termination** of processes and threads

> This supports the **multi-tasking and multi-threading**.

> Uses scheduling algorithms (like CFS - Completely Fair Scheduler) to decide which process runs on which CPU and for how long.

**2. üß† Memory Management**

> Manages **RAM and virtual memory (paging, swapping, memory mapping)**.

> Handles **allocation and deallocation** of memory for the processes

> This implement the virtual memory using **MMU (Memory management Unit)**

**3. üßæ Virtual File System (VFS)**

> This provides the basic file operations: open, read, write, close

> Abstracts filesystem access so that the kernel can support multiple filesystem types like **ext4, XFS, Btrfs, FAT, NTFS, etc**.

**4. üì° Network Stack**

> Implements the network protocols: **TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP etc**

> Supports IPv4, IPv6, firewalls (**via Netfilter**), traffic shaping, etc.

**5. üîß System Calls Interface**

> This is the interface which the **user-space application** interact with the kernal

> Also provides the access to the kernal functions (eg `read()`, `write()`, `exec()`).

**6. üîÑ Kernel Space vs User Space**

> Kernel space: Where all the components above reside.

> User space: Where applications and utilities run.

> Communication is done via system calls and APIs.

| Component             | Description                                               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scheduler**         | Allocates CPU time to processes                           |
| **Memory Manager**    | Manages RAM, virtual memory, swap                         |
| **VFS**               | Provides an abstraction layer over different filesystems  |
| **Device Drivers**    | Enable interaction with hardware                          |
| **Network Stack**     | Implements network protocols and communication            |
| **System Call Interface** | Gateway between userspace and kernel space           |
| **IPC Subsystem**     | Pipes, message queues, shared memory                      |
| **Security Subsystem**| Enforces access control and isolation                     |

## üî¢ Kernel Versioning

Linux kernel versions follow the format: `major.minor.patch`

Example:

* To check the verison: 
```bash
prajwal@prajwal-Inspiron-15-3567:~$ uname -r
6.11.0-8-generic


- `6`: Major version (architectural changes)
- `9`: Minor version (new features)
- `1`: Patch level (bug/security fixes)
```
---

## üèóÔ∏è Building the Kernel

**1. Configure the Kernel**

``make menuconfig``

**2. Compile the Kernal**

``make -j$(nproc) ``

**3. Installing the modules and kernal**

``sudo make modules_install``

``sudo make install``

**4. Update Bootloader (GRUB)**

``sudo update-grub``

**5. Reboot into New Kernel**

``sudo reboot``
